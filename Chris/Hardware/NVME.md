Add an M.2 NVMe SSD to Synology NAS

You can install up to two M.2 NVMe 2280 SSDs on your Synology NAS to create an SSD cache volume. Follow
the steps below for SSD module installation and removal.

To install an M.2 NVMe SSD module
1 Shut down your Synology NAS. Disconnect all cables from your Synology NAS to prevent possible damage.
2 The SSD slots are located at the bottom of your Synology NAS.
3 Remove the two covers protecting the modules. You will see two empty slots that are numbered as shown
below.

Note: Hold the SSD module by its edge and avoid touching the gold connectors.

4 Start from the slot 1. Insert your SSD module into the empty slot:
a Align the small gap between the gold connectors of the SSD module with the notch in the empty slot. Insert
the module into the slot. Make sure that the module is properly inserted.
b Push the lever outward as shown below. While holding the lever, push down the SSD module, then release
the lever to secure the SSD module. Replace the covers.

5 If needed, repeat the steps above to install a second SSD module into the second slot.
6 Reconnect the cables removed in step 1, then press the power button to turn on your Synology NAS.
