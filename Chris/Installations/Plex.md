# Plex

## Synology Setup

Create the following folder structure in the root of my volume 1:

- video
  - Home Videos
  - Movies
  - TV Shows

Copied all the Movies, TV Shows and home movies that I had on my desktop and other external HDs.

## Plex Setup

Created three different Plex Libraries to target the three folders I created on the Synology side of things.

- Home Videos
- Movies
- TV Shows
